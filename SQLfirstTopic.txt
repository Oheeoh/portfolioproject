Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
-- sample code
select
count (*)
from table

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

--sample code     
select                                 
count(distinct id) as totalrecords
from Business


i. Business = 10000 id (primarykey)
ii. Hours =   1562 business_id
iii. Category =  2643 business_id 
iv. Attribute =  1115 business_id 
v. Review = 10000 id (primarykey)
vi. Checkin =  493 business_id 
vii. Photo = 10000 id (primarykey)
viii. Tip = 537 user_id / 3979 business_id
ix. User = 10000  id (primarykey)
x. Friend = 11 user_id
xi. Elite_years =   2780 user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM user
WHERE id IS NULL OR name IS NULL OR  review_count IS NULL OR  yelping_since IS NULL OR  useful IS NULL OR  funny IS NULL OR  
cool IS NULL OR  fans IS NULL OR  average_stars IS NULL OR  compliment_hot IS NULL OR  compliment_more IS NULL OR  compliment_profile IS NULL OR  
compliment_cute IS NULL OR  compliment_list IS NULL OR  compliment_note IS NULL OR  compliment_plain IS NULL OR  compliment_cool IS NULL OR  compliment_funny IS NULL OR  compliment_writer IS NULL OR  
compliment_photos IS NULL
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

--sample code
select
min(stars), max(stars), avg(stars)
from review

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:1		max:	5	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg:0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg:1.9414

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their 
overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer
the following questions. Include your code.

City:	Toronto				Category: Restaurants
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

yes.There are different hours of restaurants.

   yes. 
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------+
| city    | review_count | category    | stars |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------+
| Toronto |            4 | Restaurants |   1.5 |

| Toronto |            8 | Restaurants |   4.5 |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------+
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
yes. we could tell from the table most of the 4.0 restaurants are in postal code M5V. 
The postal code with 1.5 stars are in M2N7A1. There might be some location difference in these area. 
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| city    | review_count | category    | postal_code | stars |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Toronto |            4 | Restaurants | M2N 7A1     |   1.5 |
| Toronto |            5 | Restaurants | M5B 2E5     |   2.0 |

| Toronto |            8 | Restaurants | M9A 1C2     |   4.5 |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------+

SQL code used for analysis:

---samle code
select
b.city
,h.hours
,c.category
,b.stars
from business b 
inner join hours h on b.id = h.business_id
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto' and c.category = 'Restaurants'
group by b.stars

---sample code
select
b.city
,b.review_count
,c.category
,b.stars
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto' and c.category = 'Restaurants'
group by b.stars

---sample code 
select
b.city
,b.review_count
,c.category
,b. postal_code
,b.stars
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
where b.city = 'Toronto' and c.category = 'Restaurants'
group by b.stars
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed?
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         Open businesses had higher stars, the closed businesses had lower stars
         
ii. Difference 2:
         the open businesses had higher amounts of review_count.

From business
Group by is_open  
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct 
on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   
I want to analyze the overall star rating for Jimmy Johns  business and the factor that might cause high or low rating.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I need data that has Jimmy Johns 's location. I also need to pull data that has texts review to analyze the
fatcor that might cause the rating. I need to join these table togther to show the factors that might cause the rating.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
 
+-------------+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| name        | city      | stars | text                                                                                                   | date                |
+-------------+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| Jimmy Johns | Macedonia |     5 | Fantastic food and dessert!!! Excellent ambiance. Recommend the beef ratatouille and the pea fritters. | 2014-10-23 00:00:00 |
+-------------+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select
b.name
,b.city
,r.stars
,r.text
,r.date
from business b 
inner join review r on b.id = r.id
where b.name = 'Jimmy Johns'
